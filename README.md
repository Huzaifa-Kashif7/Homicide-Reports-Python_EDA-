I recently completed a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project exploring global homicide trends using Python, and its libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly).

Key Findings:

- Top Countries: Brazil (18.45%), India (15.71%), and Nigeria (17.09%) account for over 50% of global homicides.
- Sub-Regional Trends: South America (mean homicide count: ~6,067) and Southern Asia (~6,515) are the most affected subregions.
- Regional (Continental) Trends: North America And South America dominate homicide counts (153,597 homicide cases altogether), followed by Asia (105,552 homicide cases), and Africa (99,481 homicide cases). Europe and Oceania have significantly lower rates (19,869 and 347 homicide cases, respectively).
-Yearly Patterns (Africa, Asia, And Europe): Homicide rates in Asia, Africa,and Europe fluctuated between 2006â€“2021, with noticeable spikes post-2016.

Visual Highlights:

- Geographic Disparities: Subregions like Central America and Western Africa show mean homicide counts despite lower counts in absolute terms.

- Why It Matters: Understanding these patterns can help policymakers prioritize resources for violence prevention and public safety initiatives.
